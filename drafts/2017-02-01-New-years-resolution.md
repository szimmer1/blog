#### Accountability

**/əˌkoun(t)əˈbilədē/**

*noun*

the fact or condition of being accountable; responsibility

A favorite term of business-types, chances are you've heard your boss use this word. If you're accountable for something, you must see that it gets done. At all costs. 

#### The Resolution

> My New Years' Resolution for 2017 is to make 50 open source code commits to projects other than my own. - Me

In my work life there's always accountability, sometimes for stuff that's not fun or exciting. Thankfully that doesn't usually happen in my hobbies. My interests, the fun and exciting stuff, shift rapidly  and swing widely from rock climbing to nutrition to discrete math. But now that I have a New Years' Resolution, I need some discipline. And creating a sense of accountability is my solution to having discipline for an entire year. So, at the end of every month of 2017, I will be writing about my progress towards my goal. I don't want to be empty-handed of content when the month ends - that's the sense of accountability at work, as a means to having discipline.

Having been a very minor contributor to open-source projects, this year be challenging; I hope it will also be rewarding.

#### Accepted Commits: 0/50

#### Pending Commits (PR's): 1/50

1. [json-schema-viewer](https://github.com/jlblcc/json-schema-viewer/pull/14) - Pull request to add rvm support for resolving ruby dependencies. This is a javascript project, but the build depends on a ruby sass pre-processor.


#### Looking ahead
Two interesting projects that interest me for February:

1. [Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/) - A big-data type project for putting a SQL interface on top of unstructured and non-relational structured data.
2. [OpenThread](https://github.com/openthread/openthread) - Nest open-sourced their implementation of the Thread protocol, which is a low-power, peer-to-peer alternative to wifi but operates on ipv6.
